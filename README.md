# Amazon-US-Phone-Scraping

**Description**:  
This project is focused on web scraping Amazon product data (mobile phone devices) using Python and Selenium, followed by data cleaning and preprocessing using `pandas`. The goal is to collect mobile phone information such as pricing, specifications, and ratings for further analysis.

### Features:
- **Web Scraping**: Extracts product data (mobile phones) from Amazon, including product name, prices, specifications, and reviews.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values, normalizes units (e.g., MHz to GHz, MB to GB), and preprocesses raw data into a structured format for analysis.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Converts text data into numeric values and handles inconsistencies, readying the dataset for analysis or machine learning.
